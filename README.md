**We have our first meeting on Fri 8 Sep (see below), do come and join!! We will then agree on topics ([list of potential topics](/materials/topics.txt)) and fill in the table below.**

# FSU SC Machine Learning Seminar

We are a group of people located in and around Tallahassee, all sharing an interest in machine learning. Our primary objective is the exchange of knowledge and ideas. The seminar is hosted by the Department of Scientific Computing at the Florida State University (thus FSU SC). If you are interested in getting to know us and possibly joining, we convene every Friday at 1pm at [SC-499](https://goo.gl/maps/BJLxE3Q7H1MTBqMu6). To become a part of our mailing list, please send an email to [**Nathan Crock**](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/people?uid=ndc08). We are a diverse crowd, so presenting takes some thought. Our approach is best expressed by the NASA Trichotomy of Presenting, illustrated by Nathan:
