**We have our first meeting on Fri 8 Sep (see below), do come and join!! We will then agree on topics and fill in the table below.**

# FSU SC Machine Learning Seminar

We are a group of people located in and around Tallahassee, all sharing an interest in machine learning. Our primary objective is the exchange of knowledge and ideas. The seminar is hosted by the Department of Scientific Computing at the Florida State University (thus FSU SC). If you are interested in getting to know us and possibly joining, we convene every ... -- *TBD at our first meeting on 8 Sep at SC-499 ([directions](https://goo.gl/maps/BJLxE3Q7H1MTBqMu6))*. To become a part of our mailing list, please send an email to [**Nathan Crock**](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/people?uid=ndc08).

We will agree on a schedule during our first get together. Topics that are of interest to us include: 

Transformer Architecture

Attention for very long contexts

The ins and outs of Vector Databases

Retentive Architecture

Transformer Circuitry

Emergent properties (data size vs model size vs training time)

Pre-training / Fine-tuning

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

Synthetic data for RHLAI

Various forms of prompt engineering

Instruction fine-tuning

Ethics (toxicity, bias, ...)

How to minimize bias, toxicity, etc. (technical)

From Zero to Hero (several hours)

Loss functions (Develop intuition, regression, ELBO,...)

Langchain and LLama-index, Autonomous agents (plugins)

Multi-modality: another step towards AGI

Generation of music; Generation of images. Stable diffusion (the basis of Dalle-2, Midjourney, Leonardo.ai). 


Scientific Machine Learning

ML developments in Quantum Computing

PINN algorithms

Interpretability, Explainable AI (xAI)
